description-
In this task, we will develop a Java program to track and manage student grades. The program will allow the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display the overall grade along with additional information such as letter grade or GPA.

The program will start by prompting the user to enter grades for various subjects or assignments. The user will be able to input grades multiple times, ensuring that all relevant data is captured. Once all grades have been entered, the program will calculate the average grade by summing all the grades and dividing by the number of entries.

In addition to calculating the average grade, the program will also convert the average grade into a letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) based on a predefined grading scale. Furthermore, the program will calculate the GPA if applicable, providing a comprehensive overview of the student's academic performance.

The final output will display the average grade, corresponding letter grade, and GPA in a clear and concise format. This information will help users understand the student's overall performance at a glance.

By completing this task, we will gain experience in handling user input, performing calculations, and presenting data in a user-friendly manner. This exercise will enhance our skills in Java programming and prepare us for more complex projects involving data management and analysis.
conclusion-
This project will provide practical experience in developing a Java application for tracking and managing student grades. By implementing this student grade tracker, we will solidify our understanding of user input handling, arithmetic operations, and data presentation. Successfully completing this task will equip us with the skills necessary to tackle more advanced programming challenges and enhance our ability to manage and analyze data effectively.
